###Arrays
1. [Tape Equilibrium Python](TapeEquilibrium.py) - Minimal difference that can be achieved between splices of an array.
2. [Tape Equilibrium Java](codility/TapeEquilibrium.java)
3. [Perm Missing](codility/PermMissingJava.java) - Given an array with numbers from 1...N+1 with one number missing. Find the missing number.
4. [Perm Check - xor Method](codility/PermCheck_xormethod.java) - Check if the given array of size N contains all the integers from 1 to N.
5. [Perm Check - Method 2](codility/PermCheck_Method2.java) - Check if the given array of size N contains all the integers from 1 to N.
6. [Passing Cars](codility/PassingCars.java) - Cars moving in opposite direction represented by 0's (east) and 1's (west). Find the number of passing pairs.
7. [Frog River](codility/FrogRiver.java) - A frog has to move from its starting position to a position X in a river. There is a tree near the river and at any given time a leaf falls at a position on the river. Given an array A consisting of N integers representing the falling leaves. A[K] represents the position where one leaf falls at time K, measured in minutes. Find earliest time frog can reach position X.
8. [Number of pairs with diff N](Pairs_hackerrank.java) - Given an array, and a number N, find the number of pairs in array with diff N.
9. [Max Counters](codility/MaxCounters.java)
10. [Triangle](codility/TriangleNumber.java) - Determine whether a triangle can be built from a given set of edges.
11. [Max Product of 3](codility/MaxProdOfThree.java) - Find the maximum product of 3 numbers in an array (can contain negative numbers)
12. [Rotate an array](codility/RotatingAnArray.java) - Rotate an array K times, then find the elements at a given position in the rotated array
13. [Make anagram](codility/MakeItAnagram.java) - Make a string1 anagram of string2 by deleting characters

###String Manipulation
1. [Unique String](CCI-1.py) - Check if a string has all unique characters.
2. [Real Anagrams](codility/Anagram_hackerrank.java) - Number of changes required for string1 to become anagram of strin2

###Linked List
1. [Delete Node](codility/DeleteNodeFromListGivenOnlyThatNode.java) - Delete a node from a linked list given only acces to that node
2. [Add Two Numbers Easy](codility/AddTwoNumbersLinkedListEasy.java) - Add two numbers with each digit representing a linked list node. The digits are reversed and added to linked list.
3. [Kth Element from end of a linked list](codility/KthLastElementLinkedList.java)
4. [Circulat Linked List](codility/CircularLinkedList.java) - Find the node at which loop occurs in a linked list

###Graphs
1. [Kevin Bacon - Dijkstra](djikstra.py)
2.
